## Prove Us Wrong? Prove Me Wrong? I'm confused.

Well, the initial project we were working on was Prove Me Wrong. Then we formed an organization, and we chose an organization name, inspired by the name of the project plus a wordplay: Prove Us Wrong. So, one of them is the name of the organization the other one is the name of one of our projects.

It was taking a lot of time of ours to fight with this confusion so as of March 30, we deleted references to PMW. We will keep this 
FAQ answer for a while 
for historical reasons.

## What is decentralized curation?

Decentralized curation refers to the process of organizing, evaluating, and distributing content on a digital platform through a distributed network of users or nodes, rather than relying on a central authority or algorithm. This approach aims to increase transparency, reduce the potential for manipulation or bias, and enable a more democratic and inclusive content selection process.

## What good decentralized curation does?

Decentralized curation has the potential to be useful in a variety of different contexts, depending on the specific goals and constraints of a particular application. Some potential benefits of decentralized curation include:

Resilience against censorship: Since there is no central point of control, it can be more difficult for authorities to censor or shut down a decentralized curation system.
Increased diversity of voices: By allowing multiple users to participate in curation, a decentralized system can help to promote a greater range of perspectives and ideas.
Reduced risk of bias: Without a central authority controlling the content, there is less risk of bias or manipulation in the curation process.
Examples of application would be:

News and journalism: By allowing a community of readers to curate articles and sources, a decentralized news platform could help to promote a more diverse set of voices and perspectives.
Social media: A decentralized social media platform could allow users to curate content and build their own communities, reducing the risk of censorship and bias.
Online marketplaces: Decentralized marketplaces can be curated by its own user-base, which helps to ensure that the products and services are relevant, trustworthy, and high-quality.
However, it is important to note that decentralized curation also comes with some potential drawbacks, such as the difficulty of enforcing consistent standards for content, and it require more advanced technology and governance structure.
