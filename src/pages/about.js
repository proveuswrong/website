      <h1> Who We Are </h1>

      <h2>Goals and Values</h2>
      <p>
        We identify ourselves as cypherpunks and libertarians. We believe that
        this world would be better with more freedom, thus justice, free speech,
        and privacy. We build to create more freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that coordinating for the public interest is the biggest obstacle to a better world.
        And since curation is the key element in every decision-making process, we especially have faith in decentralized curation as a solution to many problems in today's world.
        For this reason, we strive to build sustainable and censorship-resistant decentralized curation projects to make accurate and relevant information easy-to-access.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are an organization that develops decentralized curation solutions as public goods.
        We are building the next cool thing. Prove us wrong.
      </p>
